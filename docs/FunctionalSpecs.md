- Username must be unique
- Meal dates cannot be in the past when creating
- Food quantities must be positive numbers

#### 6.3 Nutritional Calculations
- Meal nutrition = sum of (ingredient nutrition * quantity/serving_size)
- Daily totals = sum of all meals for a date
- Weekly averages calculated from daily totals

### 7. Security Considerations

#### 7.1 Data Protection
- All passwords bcrypt hashed
- JWT secrets stored in environment variables
- Database credentials in .env file
- HTTPS required for production (future)

#### 7.2 Input Validation
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Input sanitization with Pydantic schemas
- Rate limiting (future enhancement)
